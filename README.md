# MemeMe

**MemeMe** is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user can share it with friends. **MemeMe** also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table or a grid.
